# ETL-Challenge: A project emphasizing the principles of ETL.

## Goals:
This project's purpose was to demonstrate basic competency with ETL theory and skills. With respect to this specific project, our goals were to find data that we could use to compare the Dow Jones Industrial Average score to the prices of Bitcoin and Gold (both in dollars). 

## Process
Our process was to find historical data for the values of the various metrics we wanted to compare, clean the data, and load all three datasets into the same dataset with the relevant points. When cleaning the data, it had to be prepared in different ways depending on how the data was tracked. The stock market, for example, is not open 7 days a week. Because of this, we could do daily comparissons, but not for all 7 days of the week. We had to drop weekend prices from the values of gold and Bitcoin. Bitcoin also came about much more recently than the other two, so we began our analysis with the earliest data we could find on Bitcoin (prices beginning in 2013). 

## Thoughts and Future Steps
This project didn't focus heavily on analysis, as it was more a proof of understanding for ETL techniques and methodology, but a historical analysis of these prices and trends with added markers for events like the 2008 recession or the current economic effects of Covid would be interesting to chart. It may also be interesting to add other currencies and stock exchanges to see differences and patterns on a global level, rather than just from an American perspective.
